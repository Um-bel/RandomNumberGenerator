# RandomNumberGenerator
a simple random number generator made with javascript

I wanted to make a random number generator, because I hear a popular high school exam is to create one. so me being an eighth grader I wanted to see if I could. And with no more than 2 hours time. I did! I don't know if it counts as "cheating" for me to do it on javascript. But that's the language that I'm most expirenced at. 

# How to use: 
npm install readline

node index.js
